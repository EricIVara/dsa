 * File Name: Main.java
 * Program Name: Sort and Binary Search Application
 * Author: Eric F. Vara
 * Course Name and Number: Data Structures and Algorithms: CPT307
 * Instructorâ€™s Name: Joel Short
 * Date Submitted: 12, February 2024
 *
 *
 * STEP 1:
 * For this assignment, you were just hired as a junior software developer as part of a team
 * of developers for a software contracting company. Your company has just won a big contract
 * to develop a software application for the United States Department of Defense. The team
 * lead has tasked you with developing a Java program that uses a binary search algorithm
 * looking for the numbers 17 and 45 from an array. Because you do not have your secret
 * clearance yet, a senior developer will later take your code and modify it for the
 * requirements of the contract.
 *
 * In this coding assignment you will utilize the Java syntax and techniques you learned while
 * reviewing the required resources for Week 2. Include comments for each section of the
 * program. You may select appropriate variable names as long as proper Java syntax is used.
 * You will also submit your source code.
 *
 * STEP 2:
 * you will continue in your role as a junior software developer from your Week 2 assignment.
 * Your team is still working on the software contract that your company won for the United
 * States Department of Defense. The team lead has tasked you with developing a Java program
 * that uses a linked list to insert and remove items. Because you do not have your secret
 * clearance yet, a senior developer will later take your code and modify it for the
 * requirements of the contract.
 *
 * In this coding assignment you will utilize the Java syntax and techniques you learned while
 * reviewing the required resources for Week 3. You may select appropriate variable names as
 * long as proper Java syntax is used. You will also submit your source code.
